👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final year graduate student at VNUHCM - University Of Science

🔬 My research interests are in Computer Vision!

📚 I'm currently working towards my Master's Thesis in the field of Computer Vision (Human Action Recognition).

📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia.

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 AI Engineer
I have experience as an AI Engineer for business projects about classifying defects in semiconductor images:

● Pre-processing and post-processing to improve model accuracy on semiconductor images using Image Processing technique (OpenCV).

● Build auto-label algorithm as a feature for Label App (filter, segmentation, edge detection, morphology…).

● Build model to classify defects on the semiconductor images (Mask RCNN).

## 📜 Research Asistant
I have experience about research in the AISIA Lab at my school:

● Research waveform classification in the Radar Communication System and generate signal data by Matlab and convert to images.

● Implement recent model (Racomnet) with different signal noise ratios and enhance model using vision transformer / combine feature by LIFA to reach higher accuracy.
